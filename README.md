# Dirty Chef Yoga
"Chef Yoga is pretty dirty. He cooks for yoga practitioners. And for some reason he's a robot."

This was the result of a 3 day game jam where we had to make a game from a name generated by The Video Game Name Generator (videogamena.me).

I implemented these systems:
- Player controller
- Input controllers: Xbox controller input, Keyboard input
- Action controller: interaction between ingredients and stations
- Ingredient and burger stacking system
- Setting up a shader to change texture based on how cooked the meat is
- Food spawner and conveyor belt
- Implementing stations: deep fryer, grill, bench, trashcan, pass and order submission
- Gizmos and debug systems
- Robot animations: idle, pickup, holding item, panic
- Hooking up audio, animations and particle FXs
- General architecture and software engineering

The awesome team I worked with that helped bring this project to fruition:
Producer: Max Brogno
Designer: Victoria Gyors
Programmers: Tony Le, Joshua Moskalewicz
Artists: Nabila Damarjati, Cameron McGillivray, Hana Jones
